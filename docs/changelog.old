* 12.02.2004-2200 christht
- Changelog format changed.
  We use cvs now, so this format is not needed, and certainly not used by the
  developers. :) I now move this file to changelog.old, and make the CHANGELOG
  more of a general 'what changed between releases' kind of thing.

#################################################
# Merged changelog files from before code merge:#
#################################################

swup: 2.0.9 - 18.11.03 - torh
- Renamed --list-new to --list-prospect (--list-new still works)

swup: 2.0.8 - 17.11.03 - torh
- Added feature --list-upgrade, lists packages that would be installed in
  upgrade mode

swup: 2.0.7 - 17.11.03 - torh
- Added feature --list-downgrade, lists packages that have higher version
  number compared to the configured repositories. Now --list-alien only lists
  packages that don't exist at all

swup: 2.0.6 - 16.11.03 - torh
- Added feature --list-alien, lists packages that are newer/alien than the
  repository defines 

rdfgen: 1.7.1 - 12.11.2003 - torh
- Use urllib2 if available

swup: 2.0.5 - 12.11.03 - torh
- Now only uses urllib2 if it present, else fallback to urllib

swup: 2.0.4 - 12.11.03 - torh
- Added output for impatient users

swup: 2.0.3 - 11.11.03 - torh
- Added feature --delete-key, removes a key from the keyring

swup: 2.0.2 - christht
- Fixed stupid 'bug' which made swup discard all not yet handled sites if:
  (current site's class) > ((preceding site's class) + 1) Fix was to remove all
  checking of pri against next_pri.  I see no reason for having this, as the
  only apparent reason is to ensure that classes are incremental in the
  sitelist, which is not documented as a requirement for swup to work.

swup: 2.0.1 - christht
- Added upgrade fixes from toreo to check multiple installations of package
  with _exact_ same version and release. (Needed for install-only stuff)

rdfgen: 1.7.0 - christht
- Minor change to fit swup 2.x.x Should be backwards compatible though.

swup: 2.0.0 - christht
- Final 2.X release

swup: 1.99.9 - christht
- One cute fix: don't care about multiple versions of installed packages.

swup: 1.99.8 - christht
- The urllib callback information got lost after moving to urllib2.  Only tell
  which package is downloaded for now, so the user dont get too disturbed when
  things slow down... :) ( If we don't find a better solution, the callback
  function may be dropped from source )
- --ignore-filter bug fixed

swup: 1.99.7 - christht
- Removed --package option, still backward compatible though. #633219

swup: 1.99.4 - christht
- Minor syntax error

swup: 1.99.3 - christht

  parsing of this rdf. Should be fixed now.
