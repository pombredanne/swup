# ========== Regexps ==========
# Regexps to control which packages should be included in an upgrade
# procedure. Please note that exclude_pkg_regexp overrides include_pkg_regexp.
#

include_pkg_regexp = ".*"
exclude_pkg_regexp = "kernel.*"

# ========== Sites ==========
# Repositories for Software Package Information (SPI).
# A site is specified by a triplet of class, URI, regexp, where packages 
# matching regexp will be downloaded from URI. 
#
# Sites are specified in order of importance by using the integer 'class'. The
# lowest integer has the highest precedence. 
#
# If two or more sites have the same class, the information is merged and the
# latest packages will be used. If the packages have the same version and
# release, the first site will be used, as it is expected to be closer to
# your location than the second.
# This means that you sould add local mirrors on top of the list, on a per 
# class basis.
#
# For increased security you should always have at least two different sites as
# class = '0', as this will normally be the main class for your distribution.
# In case your local mirror stays out of sync with the official repositories
# for a longer period of time, your system will still get the latest updates
# from the other mirror. This also means that it is considered a Good Thing
# to keep the official sites in the list, even if you will want to primary use
# local mirrors for better speed in the normal case.
